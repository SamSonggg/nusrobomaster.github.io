With an avid interest in robotics from years of experience with my school robotics team. After participating in various national competitions, I feel that I am rather familiar and comfortable with robotics systems. Nonetheless, I do hope to further build up my knowledge and expertise throughout the course of this project. Additionally, I have a good sense and knowledge in tools handling which I hope to apply to the small-scale robots that we’ll be working with in this competition.</p> <p><strong>Matthew Ong</strong></p> <p>Hi, I am a Year 2 Mechanical Eng student. Little experience in robotics - only had a short course with Lego Mindstorm back in secondary school. Main goal of joining this project is to have fun and learn something new at the same time.</p> <p><strong>Haikal</strong></p> <p>Hello everyone, my name is Haikal Yusuf, a Year 2 Mechanical Engineering student. I am passionate about anything &amp; everything STEM-related. I have experience with Robotics, having joined the Robotics club in Ngee Ann Secondary School &amp; represented the school in multiple regional &amp; division-level competitions. I mostly worked with the LEGO Mindstorms system but am looking to expand my knowledge to other Robotics Operating System (ROS) while also apply existing ideas to new systems I would get to learn during the span of this competition. I am keen to pursue a minor in Computer Science, even picking up Java in my free time. I hope I would be able to understand &amp; learn better about the software that goes into robotics &amp; hence hope to be able to interact with the Software team &amp; contribute any ideas whilst learning from them too.</p> <p><strong>Vanessa</strong></p> <p>Hi, I am Vanessa, a Year 1 Common Engineering student. Previously, I have only read up very briefly about robotics online. As of currently, due to the lack of practical knowledge and experience in robotics, I will read, search and do up some hands-on application so that I will not drag my teammates down. As such, to build up on my knowledge, I will read up more on the operation and pilot side of things to navigate systems better.  From there, I can also learn more extensively from my teammates, so that I can craft out my own insights in the ideation of the systems for my teammates. Through this project, not only will I hope to experience the new and interesting robotics environment and learn more of the relevant engineering skills, but also build up friendships and teamwork along the way.</p> <p><strong>Ashwin</strong></p> <p>Hi, I am Ashwin Nelanuthala, a year 2 Phd Student in Biological Sciences. I did my B.E in Mechanical Engineering and MSc in Physics. I have worked on a few engineering and science projects which required extensive designing and testing. Some of them include designing fixtures for special purpose machines in industry and high frequency invertors for my master’s thesis. My current Phd also involves designing microscopes and extensive programming for image processing. I would like to help the team in managing both electrical and mechanical systems. While working for this competition, I also wish to improve upon my image processing and software development skills. I hope that my engineering background and experience would help me guide the team to work effectively and I would love to learn and contribute to new ideas and experiences while working on this very interesting project.</p> <h2 id="proposed-manpower-arrangement"><a href="#proposed-manpower-arrangement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Proposed Manpower Arrangement</h2> <table><thead><tr><th>No</th> <th>Specialisation</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Personnel</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>1</td> <td>Operation</td> <td>Administrative Tasks</td> <td>Chen Yao (Leader)</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>Operation</td> <td>Accounting, Publicity</td> <td>Vanessa</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>Mechanical</td> <td>Chassis, Suspension</td> <td>Matthew, Chen Yao</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>Mechanical</td> <td>Gun, Gimbal System</td> <td>Haikal, Chen Yao</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>Electrical</td> <td>Battery, Power Distribution System</td> <td>Ashwin</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>Electronics</td> <td>Sensors and Cameras</td> <td>Ashwin</td></tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>Software</td> <td>Onboard Computer and OS</td> <td>Ashwin</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>Software</td> <td>Aimbot/ Aim Assist</td> <td>Vanessa</td></tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>Pilot</td> <td>Operator/ Gameplay Strategy</td> <td>Vanessa</td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 id="timeline-and-milestones"><a href="#timeline-and-milestones" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Timeline and Milestones</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/Timeline_WD.2e7bcf3b.png" alt="Timeline"></p> <p>For the external DJI timeline, it is based off past year deadlines.<br>
For the internal NUS timeline, it is a timeline with sufficient buffer zones to satisfy the requirement set by DJI (such as midterm video assessment).
With proper concept design and directions set for the robot, we will move on to acquiring the open sourced DJI robot. After testing its limits and parameters, we will modify and tune it accordingly to suit our competition needs.</p> <h2 id="robot-design-considerations"><a href="#robot-design-considerations" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Robot Design Considerations</h2> <p>Having analysed the past year competitions and rule book we have come up with some design considerations for the soldier robot.

Parts from hobbyist level of remote-control vehicles will be preferred. This is because they are readily available off the shelf components from hobby stores. They will provide us with the ease of access, wide range of choices and the support of hobby community.</p> <p>In the event that parts cannot be found, we will adapt them from exising parts found in live sized vehicles and scale them down accordingly. Small parts can be 3D printed for rapid protopying before the fabrication of the actual part. With access to the school's facilities, strongly believe that we can machine out the necessary and required parts.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">9/16/2019, 8:11:55 PM</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
