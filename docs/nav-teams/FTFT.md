## Introduction of Team members 

### Li Chi (Leader)

### Wang Yongtian

### Ang Yik Hong
I am a year 3 Mechanical Engineering student currently and in tend to pursue Robotics as the specialization. I have a strong interest in the field of robotics since I was young. I studied Diploma in Mechatronic and Robotics at Singapore Polytechnic after I finished my secondary school study in Malaysia. During the study in Singapore Polytechnic, I have done several robotic team projects, such as automated guided vehicle. Through the projects, I have learned a lot of skills, such as fabrication skills, problem solving skills and getting familiar with mechanical and electrical components. The reason why I would like to join the Robomaster is that I think it is a very good platform for me to strengthen my skills in Mechanical and Robotics.

## Key aspects of the robot to consider

### Chassis: 
* The chassis allows it to move in multiple directions, including forwards, sideways, diagonally, and rotate. A mecanum wheel will be used on the robot.
* A fabricated aluminium guard must be placed to cover the wheels to prevent impact.
* A suspension system will be placed at the wheels to increase the stability of the vehicle. This is also to prevent vibration during maneuvering.

### Sensors:
* Robot must be able to detect another robot within the vicinity and pin-point its location. In order to do this, a system of lidar, radar and/or camera set-up is required. The system to be adopted depends on the operating conditions of the robot.
* Robot must be able to tell friend/foe robots. This can be done using colour recognition, since opponents are not allowed to use opposing team colour in their robots. Might be useful if we can insert chips in all friendlies to detect friendlies directly.
* Sensors that detect heat produced by mechanical parts, processors to facilitate cooling and monitoring of components. Thermistors can be used for this purpose.
* Sensors to record data of different functioning parts of the robot, this data will then be used to analyse the robotâ€™s health and detect if there are any malfunctioning parts.
* Sensors to aid turret in aiming for plates of enemy robot/ other targets.
* Especially in the developmental stages of robot, it is crucial to equip as many parts of the robot with sensors to enable the collection of comprehensive data that will aid in the development and tweaking of each component of the robot. Different sensors such as accelerometer, proximity sensors and other types are required. The cases for each sensor depend on the component.

### Two-Axis Gimbal:
* Robot must be able to have a stabilized gimbal platform of which a camera and the launching mechanism would be mounted.
* The camera should be able to transmit a live first person view of the camera with clear resolution and little time delay back to its controller.
* The launching mechanism could be mounted on the same same or different gimbal platform as the camera feed.

### Projectile Supplying System:
* Projectile supply system should be able to feed projectiles to the launching mechanism reliable with a low failure rate.
* Reloading of projectile should be fast and reliable (perhaps hand-free).
* Able to transmit the ammunition to the UI in real-time.

### Launching Mechanism:
* Able to fire 17mm projectiles at its maximum barrel speed of 45m/s.
* Able to hit targets accurately at a distance of minimum 20m (arena is 28m long) with minimal spread.
* Able to track its own firing speed to prevent point deduction due to barrel overheating violations.
