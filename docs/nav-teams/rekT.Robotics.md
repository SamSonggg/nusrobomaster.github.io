## Introduction

### Mong Juin Hwaye (Hwaye)

A dare-to-dream Mechanical Engineer, currently a freshman in NUS. With a strong passion in robotics and automation, I've been an active school team representative since primary school. I represented the country to several robotic competition including the First Lego League 2016 World Festival in the USA, where we clinched onto an award on Mechanical Design. These experiences reassured me that mechanical structures, mechanisms and Artificial Intelligence will never fail to impress me into delving deeper. My constant exposure to the technology industry in China, especially in the drone and smart industries kept me attracted and this is why I wanted to participate in the DJI Robomasters!

### Tan Je Sean (Je Sean)

I am currently a Year 1 Mechanical Engineering student and have quite a large interest in the field of robotics. I was part of the robotics team back in Secondary and High School. Having also had the opportunity to participate in WRO, it showed me how designs and concepts can vary widely between others and my own and this really sparked a fire within me to further dive into the field of robotics. I loved seeing when my robot is able to run as designed, it is almost as if watching your child grow up. From the stages of conception or the final stage of completion, every step of the way is a learning journey. Whenever I stumble across an obstacle I will take it as a challenge and not rest until it has been solved.

### Teo Ru Min (Ru Min)

As a current Mechanical Engineering student, I had been into the robotics team in secondary school and had developed a passion in this area. I would really like to join this competition, and it is mainly to deepen my knowledge and understanding in this specific sector. Out of the 7 robots, I am particularly interested in the Engineer robot since this robot have more freedom in terms of the designing of mechanism. Since I plan to venture into this sector, I would like to take this opportunity to learn more about it.
