## Introduction


 - Chen Tong :computer:

   I am Chen Tong, a CEG year 2 student. In my high school I have joined VEX robotic team and participated in competitions as a structure designer. The highest prize I received is first prize In Asian-Parcific Robotic Championship. In NUS, I have joined Bumblebee Team Hornet during last year. I have experience writing computer vision algorithm in Team Hornet and I am quite familiar with the use of ROS. I am interested in learning web page design and computer vision in the future.                                                                                                                    
 - Zhao Shi :electric_plug:

   I am Zhao Shi, a year 2 student reading electrical engineering and economics. I have past coding experience using C and python. Moreover, I am familiar with hardware description languages and starting to learn assembly language this semester. Maybe I can cover more of the hardware portion.

 - Liu Haoran :wrench:

   I am Liu Haoran, a year 2 mechanical engineering student. I do not have any experience about the modeling of the robot, but I am trying to learn how to design the gun and chassis.

 - Rebecca Oei :computer:

   I am Rebecca Oei, a year 2 studying Computer Engineering. I did robotics in Secondary school, in particular competing in the VEX Robotics competition which has similar elements to Robomaster. I am interested in working on the  electrical and software aspects of the robot, as well as administrative or management roles for the team.

 - Yuan Jiayi :computer:

   I am Yuan Jiayi, a year 2 computer engineering student. I have coding experience on C and C++. I have also written motor control code in CG1112 project and held obstacle avoidance part in CG1111 project. I am interested in obstacle avoidance design of the robot.
