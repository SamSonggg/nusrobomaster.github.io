This 1.5 year attachment was where I delved into learning about the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo simulation platforms. I was an active representative of the school team, where I represented the country to several robotic competitions including the First Lego League 2016 World Festival in the USA - Mechanical Design Award. These experiences reassured me that I would always enjoy working with mechanical structures and software controls.
